Actuators:

* Relay Module: Controls the switching of electrical devices. The relay module is activated based on inputs from the proximity sensors or remote commands received over the Internet.

* Piezo-buzzer: Generates acoustic notifications when a device connected to the USB charging system is fully charged. The buzzer is controlled using PWM signals to create different sound patterns.


Communication Module:

* MQTT Protocol: Enables remote control and monitoring of the switches over the Internet. The device connects to an MQTT broker, allowing users to send commands and receive status updates from anywhere with Internet access.



Design Overview:

User Interface:

Non-contact Control: The VL6180X proximity sensors provide a user-friendly, non-contact interface for controlling the switches. Users can simply wave their hand near the sensors to turn devices on or off.
Acoustic Notifications: The Piezo-buzzer offers auditory feedback when the full-charge status is detected, ensuring users are promptly notified without needing to check their devices constantly.


Smart USB Charging System:

* Charge Detection: The OP Amp comparator continuously monitors the voltage level of connected devices. When the voltage reaches a predefined threshold indicating a full charge, the comparator triggers the buzzer to notify the user.

* Safe Charging: This system is particularly useful for devices without built-in charge protection circuitry, preventing overcharging and extending battery life.


Remote Control and Monitoring:

* Internet Connectivity: The device connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi, utilizing the SAMW25's built-in capabilities. The MQTT protocol facilitates secure and reliable communication between the device and remote users.

* Mobile and Web Apps: Users can control the switches and monitor device statuses through dedicated mobile or web applications. This feature allows for convenient and flexible management of home appliances from anywhere.

Functional Workflow:

* Power Up: The device initializes, and the PMIC ensures stable power distribution to all components.
* Sensor Monitoring: The proximity sensors continuously monitor for user gestures to control the switches.
* Charge Detection: The OP Amp comparator monitors the voltage level of connected devices.
* User Interaction: When a proximity sensor detects a hand gesture, it sends a signal to the MCU, which activates the corresponding relay to turn the device on or off.
* Remote Commands: Users can send commands via the Internet using the MQTT protocol, allowing remote control of the switches.
* Notifications: When a device reaches full charge, the OP Amp comparator triggers the Piezo-buzzer to notify the user acoustically.

### Inspiration:

The inspiration for the SwitchLink project started from a desire to enhance the safety, convenience, and efficiency of managing household electrical devices. Traditional switch controls and basic remote systems often lack the smart features needed to prevent overcharging and improve user interaction. Here are the key factors that inspired this project:

Safety Concerns: Many devices and appliances lack built-in charge protection circuitry, which can lead to overcharging, reduced battery life, and potential safety hazards. The need to create a solution that prevents these issues was a significant motivator.

Technological Advancement: With the rise of smart homes and IoT, there was a clear opportunity to develop a system that integrates modern technology like proximity sensors and Internet-based remote control to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

User Convenience: Providing an easy and intuitive way to control switches without physical contact, and offering remote control capabilities via MQTT, addresses the growing demand for convenience and automation in everyday life.

Energy Efficiency: By notifying users when devices are fully charged and enabling precise control over electrical switches, SwitchLink helps in conserving energy, aligning with broader environmental goals.


### Challenges:

The VL6180X Proximity Sensor has a driver written in C++. Rewriting the whole driver in C for ASF (Atmel Software Framework) with a Shim layer to work with the I2C Driver was a challenge. Also, to verify the correctness of the driver, I carefully reviwed the extensive datasheet to find the right list of private and public registers to be accessed and address them. This process required meticulous translation of code and ensuring compatibility with the existing framework, while maintaining the sensor's functionality and performance.

In driver writing, I also faced the issue of "Register overloading" due to memory management limiations of the C language. I figured that a simple transition from sprintf() to snprintf() while writing to the registers would solve this issue as snprintf() puts a sizing bound before writing to the register.

Building a stable VREF source for the OP Amp comparator off-the-board was another challenge. As this reference voltage is critical for accurate full-charge detection, ensuring its stability and precision was paramount. Achieving this involved careful design and testing of the voltage reference circuitry, addressing issues such as temperature stability, noise reduction, and power supply variations.


### Prototype Learnings:

1. Importance of Thorough Testing: Rigorous testing at each stage of development is crucial. I understood the importance thorough test planning, like planning proper testpoits and debug ports. Early detection of hardware and software issues can save significant time and resources. For instance, issues with the stability of the VREF source for the OP Amp comparator highlighted the need for more extensive testing of power supply variations and environmental conditions.

2. User Interface Considerations: Designing an intuitive and responsive user interface, especially with non-contact controls like proximity sensors, requires a good understanding of user behavior and needs. Iterative testing and user feedback are vital for refining the interface.

Improvements for Future Iterations

If I had to build this device again, I would consider the following changes:

On Development Level:

1. Enhanced Testing Framework: Implement a more comprehensive testing framework from the start, including automated tests for both hardware and software components. This would facilitate early detection of issues and streamline the development process.

2. Improved Modularity: Design the system with greater modularity in mind, allowing for easier updates and replacements of individual components. This would also help in scaling the project or adapting it for different use cases.

3. Advanced User Interface: Enhance the user interface by incorporating additional feedback mechanisms, such as LEDs or an LCD display, to provide users with more information and control options.

4. Internet Disconnect Button: Worried about privacy? We'll included a designated mechanical switch that physically disconnects the system from the internet, putting the user in control of their smart home.
